# sdn-module1 Lab

If you are reading this welcome to the course and congrats on completing the lab!

Since reading the documents is extremely important and is even in the name README

I will be putting notes and clues to either the current lab, On Your Own challenge,

or next weeks lab in the README file.  If you read this please keep it to yourself 

until maybe the last week of the course.  The other studets grades will not be 

affected if they don't read the README they will just struggle a little more on the 

labs which is how it is out on the job.  Most of the time the documents will

answer any questions or give you a heads up on any barriers.  For your first clue there

is another site that simply returns a joke via an API call and it's information is below.

It's URL for API calls is:

Thanks For Completing Module 1 Lab!
